## Notes

- Source: `advanced-skills-library.md` and `skills-library-implementation.yaml` from your `agent-skills` library.
- Some skill package files (e.g. `developer-skills.skill`) are packaged archives and were not extracted here; the index above uses the human-readable catalog to provide concise entries.

If you'd like, I can:

- Expand this short index to include the full 243-line detailed entries (one per skill) as separate lines with explicit tags extracted from the YAML/JSON.
- Import selected skill packages into this repo under `skills/` and attempt to read the packaged `SKILL.md` for each packaged skill.
