/*
Frontend environment example for local development. Copy to `src/front/.env`
and adjust values as needed. These variables are injected at build time by Vite.

Note: Avoid putting sensitive server-side API keys here. If a Google key is
required client-side (e.g., Maps JS), consider restricting it by HTTP
referrers in Google Cloud Console.

# Backend base URL used by the frontend during development
VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000

# Optional: expose a (restricted) google key to the frontend if you need client
# side lib (Maps JS, Places). Prefer server-side proxy when possible.
# VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-restricted-google-api-key-here

# (Optional) If using Custom Search from the frontend (not recommended):
# VITE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your-cse-id-here
